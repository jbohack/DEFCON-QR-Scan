# QR Code Redirector with Discord Webhook Notification

## About

This project is a server-side solution that provides seamless URL redirection upon scanning a QR code. It not only redirects the user to a specified URL but also issues a Discord webhook notification, capturing and sending the IP address information of the client who scanned the QR code.
